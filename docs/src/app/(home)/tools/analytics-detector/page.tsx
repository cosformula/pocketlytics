              Modern websites use various analytics platforms to understand user behavior, measure performance, and
              optimize their content. These tools range from traditional universal analytics solutions that track
              individual users across the web to privacy-focused alternatives that aggregate data without identifying
              users.

              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                <strong>HTTP header inspection</strong> - Analyzes server responses for tracking pixels and redirects
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AI classification</strong> - Uses machine learning to categorize detected tools and assess
                privacy impact

              The detection happens client-side without storing data about the websites you analyze, ensuring your own

            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Bounce rate is a key web analytics metric that measures the percentage of visitors who leave your website
              after viewing only a single page without taking any action. These visitors are called "bounced" sessions
              because they don't proceed to view additional pages or interact with your site in any meaningful way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
              For example, if you have 1,000 sessions in a month and 450 of those visitors leave after viewing only one
              page, your bounce rate would be 45%. Understanding your bounce rate is critical to evaluating whether your
              content is meeting visitor expectations and whether your site provides a good user experience.

                <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
                  A high bounce rate often indicates that your landing page content doesn't match what visitors expect
                  based on the link they clicked or search query they used. This mismatch can signal a need to improve
                  your messaging, headlines, or targeting.

                <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
                  Visitors who bounce quickly may be experiencing poor user experience factors like slow page load
                  times, confusing navigation, intrusive pop-ups, or mobile responsiveness issues. Monitoring bounce
                  rate helps you identify these problems.

                  Reducing bounce rate means more visitors stay on your site longer and have the opportunity to convert
                  into customers, subscribers, or leads. Even small improvements in bounce rate can significantly impact
                  your bottom line.

                <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
                  Bounce rates by traffic source (paid ads, email, organic search) reveal which marketing channels are
                  driving quality traffic. High bounce rates from specific sources may indicate wasted ad spend or poor
                  targeting.

              <code className="text-emerald-400 font-mono text-sm">
                Bounce Rate = (Bounced Sessions / Total Sessions) × 100

            </div>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              To calculate your bounce rate manually, divide the number of sessions where visitors viewed only one page
              by your total number of sessions, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Example:</strong> If your website had 10,000 total sessions last month and 4,500 of those were
              single-page sessions (bounces), your bounce rate would be (4,500 / 10,000) × 100 = 45%.

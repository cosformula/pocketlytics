              Google Analytics is free because Google uses it as a funnel into their ecosystem and to sell ads.
              Pocketlytics&apos;s only goal is to provide you with high quality analytics. No more confusing
              dashboards pushing random AI features nobody wants.

              Pocketlytics is similar to these simple and privacy-focused analytics platforms, but we are raising the

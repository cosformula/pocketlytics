# ClickHouse Backup Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up automated daily backups of your ClickHouse data to a Hetzner Storage Box.

## Overview

- **Backup Method**: Volume snapshot using rsync (no downtime)
- **Schedule**: Daily at midnight (with random 0-30 min delay)
- **Retention**: Last 14 backups
- **Destination**: Hetzner Storage Box (`u506048.your-storagebox.de`)

## Prerequisites

✅ SSH key authentication configured for storage box (already done via `~/.ssh/config`)
✅ Docker and ClickHouse container running
✅ Sufficient storage space on storage box (recommend 1TB+ for session replay data)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install rsync (if not already installed)

```bash
apt update && apt install rsync -y
```

### 2. Set up files

Since you're already on the ClickHouse server with the git repo:

```bash
# Navigate to the repo
cd /home/rybbit

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x clickhouse/backup-clickhouse.sh
chmod +x clickhouse/restore-clickhouse.sh

# Copy only systemd files to /etc/systemd/system
# (scripts will run directly from /home/rybbit/clickhouse/)
cp clickhouse/clickhouse-backup.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp clickhouse/clickhouse-backup.timer /etc/systemd/system/
chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/clickhouse-backup.service
chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/clickhouse-backup.timer
```

### 3. Test SSH connection to storage box

```bash
ssh box "echo 'Connection successful!'"
```

You should see "Connection successful!" output.

### 4. Enable and start the backup timer

```bash
# Reload systemd to recognize new files
systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable the timer (starts automatically on boot)
systemctl enable clickhouse-backup.timer

# Start the timer now
systemctl start clickhouse-backup.timer

# Verify the timer is active
systemctl status clickhouse-backup.timer
```

### 5. Run your first backup (optional - test before waiting for midnight)

```bash
# Manually trigger a backup to test everything works
systemctl start clickhouse-backup.service

# Watch the backup progress
journalctl -u clickhouse-backup.service -f
```

## Monitoring & Management

### Check timer status

```bash
# See when the next backup will run
systemctl status clickhouse-backup.timer

# List all timers
systemctl list-timers
```

### View backup logs

```bash
# View recent backup logs
journalctl -u clickhouse-backup.service -n 100

# Follow logs in real-time
journalctl -u clickhouse-backup.service -f

# View logs from specific date
journalctl -u clickhouse-backup.service --since "2025-01-01"

# Check the backup log file
tail -f /var/log/clickhouse-backup.log
```

### Manual backup

```bash
# Trigger a backup anytime
systemctl start clickhouse-backup.service
```

### List available backups

```bash
# SSH into storage box and list backups
ssh box "ls -lh /home/clickhouse-backups/"

# Or use the restore script
/home/rybbit/clickhouse/restore-clickhouse.sh
```

## Restore from Backup

### List available backups

```bash
/home/rybbit/clickhouse/restore-clickhouse.sh
```

This will show all available backups with their sizes.

### Restore from specific date

```bash
# Restore from backup (e.g., 2025-11-04)
/home/rybbit/clickhouse/restore-clickhouse.sh 2025-11-04
```

**Warning**: This will:
1. Stop the ClickHouse container
2. Create a safety backup of current data (stored on local disk)
3. Replace all current data with backup data
4. Restart the ClickHouse container

You will be prompted to confirm before proceeding.

## Troubleshooting

### Backup failing?

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status clickhouse-backup.service

# View detailed logs
journalctl -u clickhouse-backup.service -n 200 --no-pager

# Check log file
cat /var/log/clickhouse-backup.log
```

### Common issues:

1. **"rsync is not installed"**
   ```bash
   apt install rsync -y
   ```

2. **"Cannot connect to storage box via SSH"**
   ```bash
   # Test SSH connection
   ssh box "echo test"

   # Check SSH config
   cat ~/.ssh/config

   # Check SSH key
   ssh-add -L
   ```

3. **"Failed to find volume: clickhouse-data"**
   ```bash
   # Check volume exists
   docker volume ls | grep clickhouse

   # Check container name
   docker ps -a | grep clickhouse
   ```

4. **"Permission denied"**
   ```bash
   # Ensure scripts are executable
   chmod +x /root/backup-clickhouse.sh
   chmod +x /root/restore-clickhouse.sh
   ```

5. **Timer not running**
   ```bash
   # Reload systemd
   systemctl daemon-reload

   # Re-enable timer
   systemctl enable clickhouse-backup.timer
   systemctl start clickhouse-backup.timer
   ```

### Check storage box disk space

```bash
ssh box "df -h"
```

### Manually test rsync

```bash
# Test rsync to storage box
rsync -avz --dry-run /var/lib/docker/volumes/clickhouse-data/_data/ box:/home/test-backup/
```

## Disk Space Estimates

ClickHouse data size depends heavily on:
- Number of events tracked
- Session replay usage (can be 1000x larger than analytics data)
- Retention period (currently 30 days)

**Recommendations**:
- Monitor initial backup size
- Ensure storage box has at least 2-3x your current data size
- With 14-day retention, you need ~14x daily backup size

**Example**: If ClickHouse data is 50GB, you need ~700GB storage box space (50GB × 14 days).

## Configuration Changes

All configuration is in the backup script `/home/rybbit/clickhouse/backup-clickhouse.sh`:

```bash
# Edit backup script
nano /home/rybbit/clickhouse/backup-clickhouse.sh
```

**Common changes**:

1. **Change retention period** (default: 14 days):
   ```bash
   RETENTION_DAYS=30  # Keep 30 backups instead
   ```

2. **Change backup directory** on storage box:
   ```bash
   BACKUP_BASE_DIR="/home/my-custom-backup-dir"
   ```

3. **Change log file location**:
   ```bash
   LOG_FILE="/var/log/my-custom-backup.log"
   ```

After making changes, test the backup:
```bash
systemctl start clickhouse-backup.service
journalctl -u clickhouse-backup.service -f
```

## Backup Schedule Changes

To change the backup time, edit the timer file:

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/clickhouse-backup.timer
```

**Examples**:

- **Run at 2:00 AM**:
  ```ini
  OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00
  ```

- **Run every 12 hours**:
  ```ini
  OnCalendar=00/12:00:00
  ```

- **Run every 6 hours**:
  ```ini
  OnCalendar=00/6:00:00
  ```

After changes:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart clickhouse-backup.timer
systemctl status clickhouse-backup.timer
```

## Security Notes

- Backups are transmitted over SSH (encrypted)
- Storage box credentials are in `~/.ssh/config`
- Systemd service runs as root (required for Docker volume access)
- Consider setting up storage box sub-accounts for better security

## Performance Notes

- **Backup time**: Depends on data size and network speed
  - First backup: Full transfer (can take hours for large datasets)
  - Subsequent backups: Only changed files (much faster)

- **Network impact**: Backups use compression (`rsync -z`)

- **Server impact**:
  - CPU limited to 50% (CPUQuota in service file)
  - Memory limited to 2GB (MemoryLimit in service file)
  - Low I/O priority (IOWeight=100)

- **No downtime**: ClickHouse keeps running during backup

## Uninstall

To remove the backup system:

```bash
# Stop and disable timer
systemctl stop clickhouse-backup.timer
systemctl disable clickhouse-backup.timer

# Remove systemd files
rm /etc/systemd/system/clickhouse-backup.service
rm /etc/systemd/system/clickhouse-backup.timer

# Scripts remain in git repo at /home/rybbit/clickhouse/
# No need to delete them unless you're removing the entire repo

# Remove log file (optional)
rm /var/log/clickhouse-backup.log

# Reload systemd
systemctl daemon-reload
```

To remove backups from storage box:

```bash
ssh box "rm -rf /home/clickhouse-backups"
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check logs: `journalctl -u clickhouse-backup.service -n 200`
2. Test SSH: `ssh box "echo test"`
3. Check disk space: `ssh box "df -h"`
4. Verify container: `docker ps | grep clickhouse`
5. Test manual backup: `/home/rybbit/clickhouse/backup-clickhouse.sh`

## Next Steps

✅ Verify first backup completed successfully
✅ Monitor storage box disk usage
✅ Set calendar reminder to test restore process (quarterly recommended)
✅ Document restore procedure in your runbook
✅ Consider setting up monitoring/alerting for failed backups

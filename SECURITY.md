## Reporting a Vulnerability

We currently support the latest patch versions of the 2.x release line. Older versions are not actively maintained and may contain unpatched vulnerabilities.

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it through GitHub private security reporting for this repository:

- https://github.com/cosformula/pocketlytics/security/advisories/new

If private reporting is unavailable in your environment, open a private channel with repository maintainers first, and avoid disclosing exploit details publicly before a fix is available.

Please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and resolve the issue quickly. This includes:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots
- Your contact information (so we can follow up if needed)

We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within 72 hours, and will keep you informed throughout the resolution process.
